# CLI-Messaging

This is a program written in python that allows the server side to host rooms and the client side to enter these rooms and chat with other clients using the cli.

The communication between the client and the server is encrypted using symmetric encryption, the symmetric keys are sent using asymmetric encrytpion.

THIS HAS SOME BUGS AND I AM STILL WORKING ON IT!
